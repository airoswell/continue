## Welcome to World Sheet

#### 1. What's this for?

*Originally* the idea was very mundane. In the past few years, the authors of the site and their friends have been moving from place to place, and in the process, huge number of no-longer-needed but still perfectly functional items were left behind, or even worse, discarded. So there comes the **thoughts**:

- It was a huge waste throwing away so many stuffs.

- There should be a better way of getting the info about these items out quickly. Well there is a solution for this, we have **craigslist**, indeed. But for most of those stuffs, which weren't valuable enough for us to put down a price and write a post on **craigslist**, whose user interface is also a bit 'hostile'.

- We imagine there could be a platform for free small items circulation.

So the main purpose was to have a platform dedicated to the circulation of **free** stuffs, just to **reduce waste**.

Then the idea underwent further development.

- What should we do to really better **utilize** our stuffs?
- What should we do to truly appreciate their impact on our lives, other than using the items for a while, and throwing them away?

### Then the answer becomes clear: we need a place to keep track of everything around ourselves and how we have interacted with them. We have our own Facebook page to record everything about ourselves, while things (lifeless or living things, like your pets, plants, the world) around us deserve such a platform dedicated to them.
